Below is a sample README.md file that explains how the project works and how to run the scripts. You can copy and paste this into your project repository.

# WHOOP Data Dashboard and Analysis

This project provides tools for acquiring, analyzing, and visualizing data from the WHOOP API. It includes:

- **Basic WHOOP API Script (`main.py`)**  
  Demonstrates how to authenticate with WHOOP, retrieve user profile, sleep data, and workout data, and process the data using Pandas.

- **Interactive Dashboard (`dashboard.py`)**  
  An advanced dashboard built with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) and [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/) that allows you to visualize your WHOOP data (sleep and workout metrics) interactively.

## Project Structure
```bash
whoop-project/
├── .env              # File containing your WHOOP credentials
├── README.md         # This README file
├── requirements.txt  # List of required Python packages
├── main.py           # Basic script for WHOOP API interactions
└── dashboard.py      # Streamlit dashboard for interactive visualizations
```
## Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/whoop-project.git
cd whoop-project
```

2. Create a Virtual Environment and Install Dependencies

It is recommended to use a virtual environment. For example:

# Create virtual environment (for Windows use: python -m venv env)
```bash
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```

Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Contents of requirements.txt:

```bash
whoop
python-dotenv
pandas
streamlit
plotly
```

3. Configure Your WHOOP Credentials

Create a file named .env in the project root and add your WHOOP credentials:

# .env
```bash
USERNAME=your_whoop_email@example.com
PASSWORD=your_whoop_password
```

Note: Make sure to add the .env file to your .gitignore if you plan to use version control, so your credentials are not exposed.

## How It Works

**WHOOP API Integration**

- The project uses the whoop package to authenticate with the WHOOP API using your credentials.
- It retrieves various endpoints such as your profile, sleep data, and workout data.
- The JSON data returned by the API is processed with Pandas for further analysis.

**Data Visualization Dashboard**

- The dashboard.py script creates an interactive dashboard using Streamlit.
- Sidebar Controls: Users can select a date range for the data they wish to visualize.
- Data Tables: Raw data for sleep and workouts is displayed in interactive tables.
- Charts: Interactive charts (using Plotly) display insights such as sleep duration, sleep performance, workout strain, and average heart rate over time.

## Running the Scripts

### Running the Basic Script

To run the basic script that retrieves and processes your WHOOP data, execute:

```bash
python main.py
```

This script will:
- Load your WHOOP credentials from the .env file.
- Authenticate with the WHOOP API.
- Fetch and print your profile, sleep data (for the past 7 days by default), and workout data.

### Running the Dashboard

To launch the interactive dashboard, run:

```bash
streamlit run dashboard.py
```

A new browser window will open displaying the dashboard. Use the sidebar to select the date range and interact with the visualizations.

## Additional Information

- **WHOOP API Documentation:**
  For detailed information about available endpoints, please refer to the [WHOOP API documentation](https://developer.whoop.com/docs).

- **Customization:**
  You can extend this project by adding more API endpoints (e.g., cycles, recovery data) or additional visualizations and analytics.

- **Troubleshooting:**
  - Ensure that your .env file is correctly configured with your WHOOP credentials.
  - Verify that all required dependencies are installed.
  - Check your network connection if you experience issues connecting to the WHOOP API.
